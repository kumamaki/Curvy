# Instruments Analyzer

This tool gives you programmatic access to Apple Instruments trace data. Instruments is normally a GUI tool — this tool bridges the gap by exporting `.trace` files into DuckDB, where you can query them with SQL.

---

## When to use this tool

- You have (or want to record) an Instruments `.trace` file
- You want to analyze performance data: CPU profiling, hitches, hangs, signposts, Core Animation, SwiftUI updates, RunLoop activity, etc.
- You want root-cause analysis backed by frame-level or event-level evidence

**For scroll & animation jank diagnosis**: See [scroll_and_animation.md](scroll_and_animation.md) — a frame-first workflow for isolating interaction windows, ranking dropped frames, cascade analysis, per-frame attribution, and producing a prioritized fix plan.

---

## Workflow overview

1. **Record** a trace (or use an existing one)
2. **Export** the trace to DuckDB
3. **Explore** the exported tables
4. **Prepare** derived views (optional, for frame-level analysis)
5. **Analyze** using SQL queries against the DuckDB database

---

## Step 1: Record a trace

Use `xctrace` to record from the command line:

```bash
# Attach to a running app
xcrun xctrace record --template 'SwiftUI' --time-limit 20s \
  --output ./traces/recording.trace \
  --attach AppName --no-prompt

# Or launch the app
xcrun xctrace record --template 'SwiftUI' --time-limit 20s \
  --output ./traces/recording.trace \
  --launch /path/to/App.app --no-prompt
```

You can also use the included `PerfDebugging.tracetemplate` in Instruments.

### Choosing a template

- **SwiftUI**: SwiftUI view updates, hitches, Core Animation, signposts
- **Time Profiler**: CPU sampling with backtraces
- **Animation Hitches**: Frame lifetimes, hitch detection
- **Custom**: Combine instruments as needed

Use `xcrun xctrace list templates` to see available templates.

---

## Step 2: Export to DuckDB

The export script converts an Instruments `.trace` file into a DuckDB database with Parquet backing:

```bash
./scripts/export_to_duckdb.py traces/recording.trace traces/recording/analysis.duckdb
```

The script:
- Uses `uv run` via shebang — run it directly (not with `python3`)
- Requires [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- Creates any missing parent directories for the output path
- Exports each Instruments table as a compressed Parquet file
- Creates a DuckDB database with views referencing the Parquet files

If key tables are empty after export, recommend a different Instruments template or a longer recording.

---

## Step 3: Explore the exported tables

After export, connect to the DuckDB database and explore what's available:

```sql
-- List all tables/views
SHOW TABLES;

-- Check row counts
SELECT 'updates' AS tbl, COUNT(*) AS rows FROM updates
UNION ALL SELECT 'hitches', COUNT(*) FROM hitches
UNION ALL SELECT 'time_profile', COUNT(*) FROM time_profile
UNION ALL SELECT 'os_signpost_intervals', COUNT(*) FROM os_signpost_intervals
UNION ALL SELECT 'runloop_intervals', COUNT(*) FROM runloop_intervals
UNION ALL SELECT 'potential_hangs', COUNT(*) FROM potential_hangs;
```

### Key tables

| Table | What it contains |
|-------|-----------------|
| `updates` | Individual SwiftUI view body evaluations |
| `update_groups` | Batched SwiftUI transaction groups |
| `hitches` | Detected animation hitches (frame drops) |
| `hitches_frame_lifetimes` | Complete frame lifetime data |
| `hitches_updates` / `hitches_renders` / `hitches_gpu` / `hitches_framewait` | Per-phase frame data |
| `time_profile` | CPU sampling with backtraces |
| `os_signpost_intervals` | Signpost intervals (begin/end pairs) |
| `os_signpost` | Signpost point events |
| `os_log` | Log messages from os_log |
| `runloop_intervals` | RunLoop activity (main thread scheduling) |
| `coreanimation_context_intervals` | CA rendering phases (Layout, Display, Prepare, Commit) |
| `coreanimation_lifetime_intervals` | CA frame lifetimes with acceptable latency thresholds |
| `potential_hangs` | Detected hangs and unresponsiveness |
| `life_cycle_periods` | App lifecycle transitions |
| `swiftui_causes` | SwiftUI dependency/causality graph |
| `swiftui_changes` | SwiftUI change events with backtraces |

### Common exploration queries

```sql
-- Signpost overview (what instrumentation exists)
SELECT
  name, category, subsystem,
  COUNT(*) AS n,
  MAX(CAST(duration_ns AS BIGINT))/1e6 AS max_ms
FROM os_signpost_intervals
WHERE name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY max_ms DESC
LIMIT 50;
```

```sql
-- Worst hitches
SELECT start_ns/1e9 AS time_s, duration_ns/1e6 AS ms, narrative_description
FROM hitches
ORDER BY duration_ns DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

```sql
-- Heaviest CPU backtraces
SELECT
  COUNT(*) AS samples,
  SUM(weight_ns)/1e6 AS approx_ms,
  backtrace_json
FROM time_profile
WHERE backtrace_json IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY backtrace_json
ORDER BY approx_ms DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

```sql
-- Hang summary
SELECT hang_type, COUNT(*) AS count, MAX(duration_ns)/1e6 AS max_ms
FROM potential_hangs
GROUP BY hang_type
ORDER BY max_ms DESC;
```

---

## Step 4: Prepare derived views (for frame analysis)

The `prepare_analysis.py` script creates analysis-ready views on top of the raw exported data:

```bash
./scripts/prepare_analysis.py traces/recording/analysis.duckdb
```

This creates a `frames` view from `hitches_frame_lifetimes` with:
- Computed `missed_frames` count
- Severity buckets (Low / Medium / High / Extreme)
- Inferred frame budget from `coreanimation_lifetime_intervals.acceptable_latency_ns`
- Falls back to 60fps (16.67ms) if unavailable

Override for 120fps displays:

```bash
./scripts/prepare_analysis.py traces/recording/analysis.duckdb --budget-ms 8.33
```

### Frame-specific cascade analysis

Analyze a specific frame with surrounding context:

```bash
./scripts/prepare_analysis.py traces/recording/analysis.duckdb --swap-id 166871
./scripts/prepare_analysis.py traces/recording/analysis.duckdb --swap-id 166871 --context-frames 10
```

This outputs:
- Target frame details
- Preceding frames with budget status
- Root cause identification (first over-budget frame in a cascade)
- Signposts and logs during the root cause frame

---

## Time units

- All timestamps and durations are in **nanoseconds**
- `start_ns` is relative to trace start (not wall clock)
- Convert: `duration_ns / 1e6` for milliseconds, `start_ns / 1e9` for seconds
- `os_signpost_*` timestamps are strings — cast to BIGINT when comparing
